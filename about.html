      About Stuff You Should Know Podcast</h1>

     <p> Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant are the hosts of Stuff You Should Know, the research-based, award-winning general knowledge podcast loved around the world. Since 2008, the pair have produced more than 1500 episodes and SYSK was the first podcast to hit 500 million downloads on Apple Podcasts as well as the first to reach a billion downloads globally, and is closing in on its second billion.</p>
      
     <p> Chuck and Josh have recorded episodes on everything from disco to the time when Nazis invaded Florida in WWII, wonky stuff like trickle-down economics and voter suppression, science-y topics like the sun, global warming, bioluminescence and willpower, and just totally random topics you'd never think could be interesting like grass, zoot suits and shotgun houses (all three of those are great ones, by the way).</p>
